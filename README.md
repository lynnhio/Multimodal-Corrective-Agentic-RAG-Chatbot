# Multimodal Agentic Corrective RAG Chatbot

**Multimodal Agentic [CRAG](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/rag/langgraph_crag) Chatbot** is a comprehensive document question answering tool that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs), vector databases, and advanced RAG techniques to provide insightful answers to your questions. Whether you're a researcher, a student, or simply looking for a smart way to extract information from documents, tis app has got you covered.  
> **Corrective-RAG (CRAG)** is a strategy for RAG that incorporates self-reflection / self-grading on retrieved documents.

# Project Structure (main components):

- **agent_graph:** Contains the core logic for the CRAG agent graph.  

- **agents:** Defines the functions of each agent.  

- **database:** Manages interactions with ChromaDB for vector storage and retrieval.  

- **models:** Defines the underlying models used within each node in the graph (retriever model, grader model, etc.).  

- **parsers:** Handles document parsing for different formats (currently supports PDF and PPTX).  

- **utils:** Contains functions that are commonly used throughout the project.  

- **app:** The main class that integrates everything and launches the Gradio interface.
